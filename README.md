This repo contains a bash script named “cars.sh” that will help a user maintain an inventory of old cars.
 
 The user will be presented with a menu of three options: 
 -type the number 1 to enter a new car
 –type the number 2 to display the list of cars
 –type the number 3 to quit and exit the program

The user will have these choices and the program will execute their commands.
